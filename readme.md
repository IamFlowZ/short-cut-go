# Short Cut
When working in a terminal it can get tedious to constantly type in and manually tab through paths every time you want to move from one place to another. The next time you want to do that, you can type + tab you're way to the directory (for the last time) then enter 'short-cut *name*'. You should now have an environment variable that equals you're current working path. Now in the future when you want to get back here, all you have to do is 'cd *name*'.
